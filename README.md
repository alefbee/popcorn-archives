> **Note:** As of version 2.0.0, the command has been renamed from `popcorn-archives` to `poparch`!

A simple and powerful command-line tool to manage your personal movie watchlist, built with Python and Click.

## In Action: A Typical Workflow

Take a tour of a typical user session in this single demonstration. The animation showcases a common workflow, from populating your archive to managing and exploring your personal movie collection.

**In this demo, you can see the following sequence of actions:**

1.  **Building the Archive (`scan` & `add`):**
    The session begins by populating the archive. First, `poparch scan` quickly imports an entire directory of local movie folders. Immediately after, a single movie is added manually with `poparch add "The Matrix 1999"`.

2.  **Enriching the Data (`update`):**
    With movies now in the database, `poparch update` is run. The tool finds all movies with incomplete information and automatically fetches their rich metadata (genre, cast, director, etc.) from TMDb.

3.  **Getting Insights (`stats`):**
    After the update, the user runs `poparch stats` to see the beautiful, personalized dashboard. This provides an instant overview of the collection and reveals interesting patterns about their movie taste.

4.  **Managing a Specific Movie (`watch` & `rate`):**
    The user then manages the movie added earlier, marking it as seen with `poparch watch "The Matrix 1999"` and giving it a perfect 10-star personal rating using `poparch rate "The Matrix 1999" 10`.

5.  **Viewing the Final Result (`info`):**
    Finally, `poparch info "The Matrix 1999"` is used to view the complete details for that movie. The output now shows the fully enriched data from the API, as well as the user's personal rating and watched status, all in one clean card.

> **Tech Note:** The animation above is a high-quality **APNG** (Animated PNG), not a GIF. This modern format is supported by GitHub and allows for perfect color reproduction and better compression.

## Features

### üóÇÔ∏è Collection Management
-   **Flexible Importing**: Seamlessly build your collection by **scanning** directories of movie folders, **importing** from standard CSV files, or migrating your entire history from a **Letterboxd** ZIP export.
-   **Personal Ratings & Watched Status**: Keep track of what you've seen with `watch`/`unwatch` and rate movies on a 1-10 scale with the `rate` command. Your Letterboxd ratings are imported automatically!
-   **Keep Your Archive Rich**: Use the `update` command to fetch rich metadata for your entire collection at once. The process is robust and provides a detailed summary of successes and failures.

### üîé Discovery & Exploration
-   **Smart & Interactive Info**: The powerful `info` command acts as your gateway to movie knowledge. It intelligently finds movies both locally and online, with interactive menus for ambiguous queries.
-   **Advanced Search & Filtering**: Instantly search your local archive with a rich `search` command that can filter by title, `--actor`, `--director`, `--keyword`, and `--collection`.
-   **Personalized Stats Dashboard**: Uncover insights into your collection and personal taste with the beautiful `stats` dashboard, which analyzes your top genres, favorite directors, and more.
-   **Interactive Genre Filtering**: Use the `genre` command without arguments to get a dynamic, numbered list of all genres in your archive to choose from.

### üîß Under the Hood
-   **Rich Movie Details**: Fetches comprehensive movie information‚Äîincluding cast, runtime, collection, and IMDb links‚Äîfrom TMDb and caches it locally.
-   **Robust & User-Friendly**: The application is designed to be resilient. It gracefully handles errors (like unparsable folder names) and provides clear, helpful feedback.
-   **Persistent & Safe Storage**: Uses a standard user data directory for its SQLite database, ensuring your archive is safe and independent of the project folder.

## Installation & Configuration

### Option 1: As a System-Wide Command (Recommended for Users)

If you just want to use the application, the best way is to install it with `pipx`. This installs the tool in an isolated environment but makes the command available everywhere in your system.

**1. Install `pipx`**
If you don't have it, install `pipx` using your system's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install pipx`, `brew install pipx`). Then, ensure its path is configured:
```bash
pipx ensurepath
```
*(You may need to restart your terminal for this change to take effect.)*

**2. Install Popcorn Archives**
Clone the repository and install directly from the local path:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alefbee/popcorn-archives.git
cd popcorn-archives
pipx install .```
The `poparch` command is now ready to use!

### Option 2: For Development

If you want to modify or contribute to the code, set it up in a local virtual environment.

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alefbee/popcorn-archives.git
cd popcorn-archives
```
**2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
**3. Install Dependencies and the Project**
Install all dependencies (including development tools like `pytest`) and the project in editable mode:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -e .
```

### Step 3: Configure Your API Key (Required for Movie Details)

To fetch movie details, you need a free API key from **The Movie Database (TMDb)**.

1.  **Get a free API key**:
    -   Sign up at [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup) and request a key from your account **Settings ‚Üí API**.
2.  **Set the key in the app**:
    Run the `config` command once to save your key:
    ```bash
    poparch config --key YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY
    ```

## Updating

To update Popcorn Archives to the latest version, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
# Get the latest changes from GitHub
git pull origin main

# Re-install to apply updates
# If using pipx:
pipx install --force .

# If using a virtual environment:
pip install -e .
```

## About This Project

This project was developed as a personal learning journey to create a useful, real-world command-line application in Python. It was an opportunity to practice key software development concepts, including:

-   Building a robust CLI with `Click`.
-   Database management with `SQLite`.
-   Creating an installable package with `setuptools`.
-   Following best practices for project structure and documentation.
-   Implementing version control with Git and GitHub.

This project was built with significant assistance from AI tools like Google's Gemini.
