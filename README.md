# Popcorn Archives üçø

[![Run Python Tests](https://github.com/alefbee/popcorn-archives/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/alefbee/popcorn-archives/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

> **Note:** As of version 2.0.0, the command has been renamed from `popcorn-archives` to `poparch`!

A simple and powerful command-line tool to manage your personal movie watchlist, built with Python and Click.

## In Action: A Typical Workflow

Take a tour of a typical user session in this single demonstration. The animation showcases how several key commands work together to manage and explore your movie collection.

**In this demo, you can see the following sequence of actions:**

1.  **Populating the Archive (`scan` & `add`):** The session begins by using `poparch scan` to quickly import an entire directory of movie folders. A single movie is then added manually with `poparch add`.
2.  **Checking the Dashboard (`stats`):** Immediately after, the user runs `poparch stats` to see a beautiful, colorful dashboard summarizing the newly populated archive.
3.  **Enriching the Data (`update`):** With the movies added, the `poparch update` command is run. It automatically finds all movies with missing details and fetches their genre, plot, and rating information from the OMDb API.
4.  **Viewing Movie Details (`info`):** To see the newly fetched data, the user runs `poparch info` on a specific movie, displaying its detailed information card.
5.  **Getting a Recommendation (`random --unwatched`):** Finally, looking for a movie to watch, the user runs `poparch random --unwatched` to get a suggestion for a great film they haven't seen yet.
## Features

-   üåê **Rich Movie Details**: Fetch detailed movie information‚Äîincluding genre, director, plot, and ratings‚Äîfrom **The Movie Database (TMDb)**.
-   üìù **Watched Status Tracking**: Keep track of which movies you've seen with the `watch` and `unwatch` commands. Get random suggestions just from your unwatched list!
-   üîÑ **Bulk Updates**: Fetch details for your entire collection at once. The process is robust, provides detailed progress, and gives a final summary of successes and failures.
-   üè∑Ô∏è **Interactive Genre Filtering**: Use the `genre` command without arguments to get a dynamic, numbered list of all genres in your archive to choose from.
-   ‚úÖ **Flexible Movie Detection**: Intelligently scans your movie directories using common naming formats.
-   ‚ú® **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully skips unparsable folders and handles network timeouts without crashing.

## Installation & Configuration

### Option 1: As a System-Wide Command (Recommended for Users)

If you just want to use the application, the best way is to install it with `pipx`. This installs the tool in an isolated environment but makes the command available everywhere in your system.

**1. Install `pipx`**
If you don't have it, install `pipx` using your system's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install pipx`, `brew install pipx`). Then, ensure its path is configured:
```bash
pipx ensurepath
```
*(You may need to restart your terminal for this change to take effect.)*

**2. Install Popcorn Archives**
Clone the repository and install directly from the local path:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alefbee/popcorn-archives.git
cd popcorn-archives
pipx install .```
The `poparch` command is now ready to use!

### Option 2: For Development

If you want to modify or contribute to the code, set it up in a local virtual environment.

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alefbee/popcorn-archives.git
cd popcorn-archives
```
**2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
**3. Install Dependencies and the Project**
Install all dependencies (including development tools like `pytest`) and the project in editable mode:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -e .
```

### Step 3: Configure Your API Key (Required for Movie Details)

To fetch movie details, you need a free API key from **The Movie Database (TMDb)**.

1.  **Get a free API key**:
    -   Sign up at [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup) and request a key from your account **Settings ‚Üí API**.
2.  **Set the key in the app**:
    Run the `config` command once to save your key:
    ```bash
    poparch config --key YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY
    ```

## Updating

To update Popcorn Archives to the latest version, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
# Get the latest changes from GitHub
git pull origin main

# Re-install to apply updates
# If using pipx:
pipx install --force .

# If using a virtual environment:
pip install -e .
```

    -   Expand the `config` command to allow users to customize aspects of the application, such as default output formats or color schemes.

### New Commands & Features
-   [ ] **Smart Recommendations**:
    -   Create a new `poparch recommend <'Title YYYY'>` command that uses the TMDb API to suggest similar movies.
-   [ ] **Personal Ratings & Notes**:
    -   Add a `poparch rate <'Title YYYY'> <score>` command to allow users to add their personal ratings.
    -   Implement a `poparch note <'Title YYYY'>` command that opens the system's default text editor for writing personal notes.
-   [ ] **Playlists / Custom Lists**:
    -   Introduce a full-featured list management system (`list create`, `list add`, `list show`) to organize movies into custom collections.
-   [ ] **Import from Letterboxd**:
    -   Add a powerful importer to read a user's exported CSV from **Letterboxd**, including their ratings and watched status.
